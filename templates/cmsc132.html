      <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is
        based on the concept of objects. An object is an instance of a class,
        which is a blueprint or template for creating objects. In OOP, you
        define classes that encapsulate data and behavior, and then you create
        objects from those classes that can interact with each other.

        <br /><br />
        There are four main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, inheritance,
        polymorphism, and abstraction.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Encapsulation</b> is the idea of bundling data and behavior together
        into a single unit called a class. This is done to protect the data from
        outside interference and to make it easier to manage and modify.
        Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers, such as
        public, private, and protected, which control the visibility of data and
        methods within a class.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Inheritance</b> is the idea of creating new classes that are based on
        existing classes. The new classes, called subclasses or derived classes,
        inherit the properties and methods of the existing classes, called
        superclasses or base classes. Inheritance is used to create specialized
        versions of existing classes, and it allows you to reuse code and avoid
        duplication.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Polymorphism</b> is the idea of using a single interface to represent
        multiple types of objects. Polymorphism is achieved through the use of
        interfaces and abstract classes, which define a set of methods that can
        be implemented differently by different classes. Polymorphism allows you
        to write more flexible and reusable code that can work with objects of
        different types without needing to know the specific implementation
        details of each object.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Abstraction</b> is the idea of focusing on the essential features of
        an object or system while ignoring the non-essential details.
        Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and
        interfaces, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by
        subclasses. Abstraction allows you to write code that is more general
        and can be applied to a wider range of objects or systems.

      <h2>Abstract Classes</h2>
      <p>
        In Java, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated
        directly. Instead, it is meant to serve as a blueprint or template for
        other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes are declared using the
        abstract keyword in the class definition. An abstract class can contain
        both abstract and non-abstract methods. An abstract method is a method
        that has no implementation and is declared using the abstract keyword in
        the method signature. Any class that inherits from an abstract class
        must either provide an implementation for all of the abstract methods in
        the abstract class, or be declared as abstract itself. Here is an
        example of an abstract class in Java:
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <md-block>
            ```java 
            public abstract class Shape {
              protected int x;
              protected int y;
          
              public Shape(int x, int y) {
                  this.x = x;
                  this.y = y;
              }
          
              public abstract double getArea();
          
              public abstract double getPerimeter();
          
              public void printLocation() {
                  System.out.println("Location: (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
              }
            }
            ```
          </md-block>
      <p>
        In this example, the <code>Shape</code> class is declared as abstract,
        and has two instance variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. The
        class also has three methods, <code>getArea()</code>,
        <code></code>getPerimeter(), and <code></code>printLocation(). The first
        two methods are declared as abstract, while the third method has a
        default implementation. Any class that inherits from the
        <code>Shape</code> class must implement the <code>getArea()</code> and
        <code>getPerimeter()</code> methods, or be declared as abstract itself.
        For example:
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <md-block>
            ```java 
            public class Rectangle extends Shape {
              private double width;
              private double height;
          
              public Rectangle(int x, int y, double width, double height) {
                  super(x, y);
                  this.width = width;
                  this.height = height;
              }
          
              public double getArea() {
                  return width * height;
              }
          
              public double getPerimeter() {
                  return 2 * (width + height);
              }
            }
            ```
          </md-block>
      <p>
        In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> class inherits from the
        <code>Shape</code> class, and provides implementations for the
        <code>getArea()</code> and <code>getPerimeter()</code> methods. It also
        has its own instance variables, <code>width </code> and
        <code>height</code>, and a constructor that takes four parameters.
        Abstract classes are useful for creating a hierarchy of related classes,
        where the abstract class defines common behavior and properties, and the
        concrete subclasses provide more specific implementations. Abstract
        classes can also help enforce consistency and reduce duplication in a
        program's codebase.
